			<p><span></span>In ancient times, the island is called <em>Elafonessos</em> (deer) because of the deer walking in their forests. 
			According to another theory, the colonists who set foot on the island had drank water from a local woman's pot and 
			called the island <em>Prokonnisos </em>, which means the island of pot. Towards the end of the 6th century BC, the island was
			named the <em>New Prokonnisos</em> and later it was called just <em>Prokonnisos</em>. Before this period, the island is known as <em>Neuris.</em></p>											
														
			<p><span></span>At the end of the 17th century, this island was given the name <em>Adelfonessos</em> , which means the sibling 
			island, and the name of the <em>Protonnesos</em> which means the main island. The emperor of Byzantium presented the 
			island as a dowry to his daughter in the era of Justinian. In this period, the island was called <em>Preikanisos</em>.</p>	

			<p><span></span>It is not clear when the island gets the name of  <em>Marmara</em>. This name which comes from <em>marmor (marble)</em>
			is understood to have been used especially by Italian sailors during the Byzantine period.</p>
			<p><span></span>The oldest map of Marmara Island, drawn in 1528 by Benedetto BORDONE.The name of the map is <em>Map of Marmara Sea(Propontis) and the Bosphorus straits. </em> </p>

			<p><span></span>Until 1922, 5 of the 6 villages on the island were non-Muslim. In the population exchange, they sent all 
			the Greeks from the island and placed there the Turkish immigrants from Girit. Later , a lot of people from Black-sea came 
			and settled the island. Few of the old stone buildings built by the Greeks have survived to the present day. The most 
			prominent of these beautiful buildings is the marble columned high school building in the Marmara center. There are still 
			church ruins on the upper part of the island and at one time many people have visited the island to find treasures in these regions.</p>
