			<p><span></span>It is possible to reach the Marmara Island in 2.5 hours by taking the ferries from Tekirdağ-Barbaros.
			You can reach the center of the island in 2 hours by ferryboats from Erdek or Avşa Islands.</p>
			<p><span ></span>It is more advantageous for passengers who do not have a car to travel from İstanbul to the
			Island to use İDO sea buses. Sea buses departing from Yenikapı or Bostancı first come to the island
			of Marmara and then goes to Avşa. The journey takes 2.30 or 3 hours. We usually recommend you to 
			take a cardigan because the air conditioners work very hard on the sea bus. You can visit 
			<a href="https://www.ido.com.tr/" id="ido" target="_blank">this</a> site to see IDO expeditions and buy ticket. If you get 
			tickets early, you can catch promotions.</p>
			<p><span ></span>Although there were direct voyages to the village of Topağaç in the past, Serdar5 ship is
			only available for holidays. The distance between each village is approximately 10-14 km.
			Municipal buses depart every hour. You can also go to other villages by taxi.</p>
