				<h2>TOPAĞAÇ VILLAGE</h2>
				<hr style="width:300px;">
				<br>
				<p><span ></span>Topağaç Village is connected to municipality of Marmara and is 10 km away from the Marmara center. 
				The large fields in the Topağaç Village, known as the granary of the island, add a lush green image to 
				the village. The village is named Topağaç because of the pine trees being round. Also olive trees all 
				cover the foothills. Herbs such as thyme, sage tea, lavender, walnut are found in these mountains.</p>
				<p><span></span>Today’s locals are mostly immigrants and from the Black sea region. The village is visited by peasants 
				and tourists in the summer while the villagers remain in the winter. Especially during the holidays, 
				the village becomes very crowded and probably there is no vacancy in the hostels.</p>
				<p><span></span>The Greek name of the village is <em>"Klazaki"</em></p>
				<p><span></span>Peasants earn their livelihood with the agriculture and stock raising. They bring fresh crops on 
				Thursday to the public market in the Marmara Center and sell them. In addition, many fish-lovers in 
				the village sail to the sea with their own boats and catch fishes such as bonito and horse-mackerel.</p>
				<p><span></span>Topağaç has the longest beach of the island. The sea is rough when the weather is closed. Because 
				the bay is exposed. But the fact that it is not too deep (gradually increased) and that the coast is 
				covered with sand makes the coast valuable. For morning sport, taking a tour on the beach is ideal. 
				You can enjoy the beach by jumping off the cliffs called <em>Jumbot</em>.</p>

				<br>
				<p><span ></span>There is one primary school in the village. Students must go to other villages for secondary and 
				high school.There is one health center in the village square and first aid can be provided in case of 
				emergency. However, it is imperative to visit Marmara Center to provide medicines and special interventions.</p>
				<p><span></span>In recent years, the village was developed with new basketball, football field and playground.
				Şok and Hekimoğlu markets were opened. There is a butcher, a barber and a lahmacun hall in the village.</p>
				<p><span ></span>It is imperative to go to the Marmara Center to pay the bills because the post office is only located 
				in there. Unfortunately, there is no bank or ATM in the village.</p>
				<p><span></span>Topağaç is the most calm and quiet village of the island and the villagers usually gather 
				in the tea garden. They play okey game and drink tea. Sometimes there are cycling tours on the island.
				Bicycles are driven from Asmalı village to Marmara center. It is given a break in the Topağaç village 
				which is located between them.</p>
				<p><span ></span>Wedding ceremonies on the island are usually set up in the village square and the announcement 
				is made in other villages of the island too. All the people of island are invited. It is also 
				announced when fresh fishes are sold. The village market is set up on Tuesday.</p>
				<p><span ></span>Formerly, <em>Serdar 5</em> ship was landed the village harbor from Tekirdağ. The interesting thing about 
				this trips is that everyone on the island waving to the passengers when they see the ship. Many times
				you could see people on the balcony or on the beach saying welcome or goodbye by waving hands. You don't 
				need to know any of them. If you wave at them, they will respond to you.</p>
				<p><span ></span>It must be hard to forget that tradition in my memory : when you leave the village 
				with Serdar 5 ship, the people you knew would come to see you off and without exception
				on every departure of the ship,it could be played the song called <em>“Müsadenizle Çocuklar” </em>
				by Barış Manço. The chorus of the song is as follows: </p>
				<blockquote><pre>
		Wave your hand , wave your hand
		Wave your arm , wave your arm
		Wave left as you show right , wave left as you show right
		Dash a shoulder and overtake from the right side.
				</pre></blockquote>
				<p><span></span>I think the villagers have a strange obsession with waving hand.You can
				listen the song from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSI-Kuetzq4" target="_blank" id="barıs_manco">here</a>.</p>

				<video width="600" height="290" controls src="images/serdar_5.mp4" style="transform: translate(+50%, 0%);" ></video>
				
				<br>
				<p><span ></span>In addition, young people from the village used to jump from the stern of the 
				ship to the sea before the ship is far from the village.And they used to swim to the coast.
				It was always fun to watch.I found a very old video on the internet from this moment.Sorry about the quality.</p>

				<h2 class="how-to-go">HOW TO GO ?</h2>
				<hr style="width:300px;">
				<br>
				<p><span></span>It is possible to reach the Marmara Island in 2.5 hours by taking the ferries from Tekirdağ-Barbaros.
				You can reach the center of the island in 2 hours by ferryboats from Erdek or Avşa Islands.</p>
				<p><span ></span>It is more advantageous for passengers who do not have a car to travel from İstanbul to the
				Island to use İDO sea buses. Sea buses departing from Yenikapı or Bostancı first come to the island
				of Marmara and then goes to Avşa. The journey takes 2.30 or 3 hours. We usually recommend you to 
				take a cardigan because the air conditioners work very hard on the sea bus. You can visit 
				<a href="https://www.ido.com.tr/" id="ido" target="_blank">this</a> site to see IDO expeditions and buy ticket. If you get 
				tickets early, you can catch promotions.</p>
				<p><span ></span>Although there were direct voyages to the village of Topağaç in the past, Serdar5 ship is
				only available for holidays. The distance between each village is approximately 10-14 km.
				Municipal buses depart every hour. You can also go to other villages by taxi.</p>

				<h2 class="tipss">THINGS TO DO</h2>
				<hr style="width:270px;">
				<br>
				<ol>
					<li><p>We recommend you to taste the sage and verjuice in the tea gardens. The verjuice of the island is famous. 
					It is made from underripe grape.</p></li>
					<li><p>When the sea is rough , you can go to the Monastery Bay which is 15 minutes walk to the village and enjoy 
					the sea. The water is quite clean and you can extract mussels under the rocks by snorkelling. You can have a 
					picnick under the olive trees. Don't forget to pass to the other bays especially to the white bay. ( I recommend 
					you to go with solid slippers. Because the monastery is rocky.So many slippers have given their lives to this cause. 😊 )</p><br></li>

					</li>
					
					
				</ol><br>
				<ol start="3">
					<li ><p>If you see a group of young people playing guitar on the beach in the evening , you can join them
					without hesitation. You can light a fire while listening to the waves rolling onto the beach. Under the starry sky ,
					this atmosphere will leave a deep mark on you.</p></li>
					<li><p>You can go for hiking when the weather is overcast to swim. You can visit the waterfall at the end of the fields.
					It dries due to the weather conditions in summer. However, the shapes of rocks are worth-seeing.</p></li>
					<li><p>As the village is poor in terms of entertainment, it is possible to go to Marmara Center at night.
					You can eat famous island ice cream with the bagel. You will regret if you do not eat the hot bagel which
					comes out of the oven at 10 pm. There is also a disco in the center : <em>Prokonnisos disco.</em></p></li>
					<li><p>Going to the big-rock is on the list of things to do for lovers of hiking. Even how hard it
					is to wear your sneakers and climb the mountain for 1.30 hours , the scenery you'll see is worth it.</p><br></li>

					see plane trees planted in 1001. Behind the beach there are very nice eating places.The marble statues made by 
					university students in many streets of the village where the marble 
					quaries are located, is a reason to go there. Saraylar’s beach is very well maintained and the sea is 
					too shallow. Your children can enjoy in the newly built Abroz Masal Park behind the beach.</p><br><br></li>
