			<h1 class="main-title">Marmara Island - Topağaç Village</h1>
			<p>Topağaç Village is connected to municipality of Marmara and is 10 km away from the Marmara center. 
			The large fields in the Topağaç Village, known as the granary of the island, add a lush green image to 
			the village. The village is named Topağaç because of the pine trees being round. Also olive trees all 
			cover the foothills. Herbs such as thyme, sage tea, lavender, walnut are found in these mountains.</p>
			<p>Today’s locals are mostly immigrants and from the Black sea region. The village is visited by peasants 
			and tourists in the summer while the villagers remain in the winter. Especially during the holidays, 
			the village becomes very crowded and probably there is no vacancy in the hostels.</p>
			<p>The Greek name of the village is <em>"Klazaki"</em></p>
			<p>Peasants earn their livelihood with the agriculture and stock raising. They bring fresh crops on 
			Thursday to the public market in the Marmara Center and sell them. In addition, many fish-lovers in 
			the village sail to the sea with their own boats and catch fishes such as bonito and horse-mackerel.</p>
			<p>Topağaç has the longest beach of the island. The sea is rough when the weather is closed. Because 
			the bay is exposed. But the fact that it is not too deep (gradually increased) and that the coast is 
			covered with sand makes the coast valuable. For morning sport, taking a tour on the beach is ideal. 
			You can enjoy the beach by jumping off the cliffs called <em>Jumbot</em>.</p>

			<p>There is one primary school in the village. Students must go to other villages for secondary and 
			high school.There is one health center in the village square and first aid can be provided in case of 
			emergency. However, it is imperative to visit Marmara Center to provide medicines and special interventions.</p>
			<p>In recent years, the village was developed with new basketball, football field and playground.
			Şok and Hekimoğlu markets were opened. There is a butcher, a barber and a lahmacun hall in the village.</p>
			<p>It is imperative to go to the Marmara Center to pay the bills because the post office is only located 
			in there. Unfortunately, there is no bank or ATM in the village.</p>
			<p>Topağaç is the most calm and quiet village of the island and the villagers usually gather 
			in the tea garden. They play okey game and drink tea. Sometimes there are cycling tours on the island.
			Bicycles are driven from Asmalı village to Marmara center. It is given a break in the Topağaç village 
			which is located between them.</p>
			<p>Wedding ceremonies on the island are usually set up in the village square and the announcement 
			is made in other villages of the island too. All the people of island are invited. It is also 
			announced when fresh fishes are sold. The village market is set up on Tuesday.</p>
			<p>Formerly, “Serdar 5” ship was landed the village harbor from Tekirdağ. The interesting thing about 
			this trips is that everyone on the island waving to the passengers when they see the ship. Many times
			you could see people on the balcony or on the beach saying welcome or goodbye by waving hands. You don't 
			need to know any of them. If you wave at them, they will respond to you.</p>
			<p>It must be hard to forget that tradition in my memory :when you leave the village 
			with Serdar 5 ship, the people you knew would come to see you off and without exception
			on every departure of the ship,it could be played the song called “Müsadenizle Çocuklar” 
			by Barış Manço. The chorus of the song is as follows: </p>
			<blockquote><pre>
	Wave your hand , wave your hand
	Wave your arm , wave your arm
	Wave left as you show right , wave left as you show right
	Dash a shoulder and overtake from the right side.
			</pre></blockquote>
			<p>I think the villagers have a strange obsession with waving hand.You can
			listen the song from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSI-Kuetzq4" target="_blank" id="barıs_manco">here</a>.</p>
			<p>In addition, young people from the village used to jump from the stern of the 
			ship to the sea before the ship is far from the village.And they used to swim to the coast.
			It was always fun to watch.I found a very old video on the internet from this moment.Sorry about the quality.</p>

			<h1 class="how-to-go">HOW TO GO TO THE MARMARA ISLAND?</h1>
			<p>It is possible to reach the Marmara Island in 2.5 hours by taking the ferries from Tekirdağ-Barbaros.
			You can reach the center of the island in 2 hours by ferryboats from Erdek or Avşa Islands.</p>
			<p>It is more advantageous for passengers who do not have a car to travel from İstanbul to the
			Island to use İDO sea buses. Sea buses departing from Yenikapı or Bostancı first come to the island
			of Marmara and then goes to Avşa. The journey takes 2.30 or 3 hours. We usually recommend you to 
			take a cardigan because the air conditioners work very hard on the sea bus. You can visit 
			<a href="https://www.ido.com.tr/" target="_blank">this</a> site to see IDO expeditions and buy ticket. If you get 
			tickets early, you can catch promotions.</p>
			<p>Although there were direct voyages to the village of Topağaç in the past, Serdar5 ship is
			only available for holidays. The distance between each village is approximately 10-14 km.
			Municipal buses depart every hour. You can also go to other villages by taxi.</p>
